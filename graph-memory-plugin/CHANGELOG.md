# Changelog

## [3.1.0] (2026-06-25) — Version Label Cleanup

### Fixed

- **Extension mental model injection was dead** — both `extensions/graph-memory.ts` (pi) and `extensions/graph-memory-opencode.ts` imported `hasV3Data`/`buildV3Context` from `session-start-context.js`, but those exports were renamed to `hasMentalModelData`/`buildSessionStartContext` during the earlier naming cleanup. The broken imports silently resolved to `undefined`, so mental model injection never fired in either extension. Fixed to use correct export names.

### Changed

- **All version labels removed** — v2/v3/v4 labels removed from source code, extensions, tests, and docs. File names and function names now describe function, not version history.
- **Whisper fallback removed from extensions** — extensions no longer read `mind/whisper.txt` as a fallback. Model.json is the single mental model source.
- **`buildV2Injection` → `buildFallbackInjection`** — renamed across all adapters.
- **`GRAPH_MEMORY_V3` env var removed** — was referenced in docs/tests but never read by source code.
- **`tests/v3-pipeline.check.mjs` → `tests/pipeline.check.mjs`** — test names and module paths updated.
- **`scripts/migrate-v2-to-v3.ts` → `scripts/migrate-mental-model.ts`** — renamed.

## [3.0.1] (2026-05-29) — Lifecycle Audit Hardening

### Daemon Crash Resilience (P0 fixes)

The daemon main loop had no catch block — any tick-level error permanently killed the daemon. Three compounding bugs made this likely:

1. **Tick housekeeping wrapped in try/catch** — `scavengeStaleBuffers()`, `cleanupOrphanSnapshots()`, `reconcileProjectWorkingBacklog()`, and all other tick functions now run inside a try/catch so a single file I/O error doesn't terminate the daemon.
2. **Per-file I/O guarded** — `scavengeStaleBuffers()` and `cleanupOrphanSnapshots()` wrapped each file iteration in try/catch (TOCTOU race: file deleted between `readdirSync` and subsequent `statSync`/`readFileSync`).
3. **Outer daemon catch added** — safety net catch block added to the daemon loop so fatal errors log and clean up instead of crashing silently.

### Ambient Recall Deduplication

`STOPWORDS`, pattern arrays (`EXPLICIT_MEMORY_PATTERNS`, `CONTINUITY_PATTERNS`, `PREFERENCE_PATTERNS`, `REPO_OPERATING_CONTEXT_PATTERNS`), `pathCategory()`, `categoryGateWeight()`, `countMatches()`, and the full `ambientRecall()` function extracted from three files into `src/graph-memory/scoring.ts`:

- `src/hooks/on-user-message.ts` — ~175 lines removed, imports from shared module
- `extensions/graph-memory.ts` (pi) — ~110 lines removed, thin `doAmbientRecall()` wrapper
- `extensions/graph-memory-opencode.ts` — ~80 lines removed, preserves `detectCurrentProject()` and `_updateLastAccessed` post-processing

### v2/v3 Merge Completion

- Observer `upsert_node` redirected from `CONFIG.paths.v3Graph` to `CONFIG.paths.nodes`
- Diverged `graph/` directory archived to `archive/v3-graph-backup/`
- Whisper injected as prefix before v2 context at session start (not gated by `hasV3Data()`)
- `GRAPH_MEMORY_V3=1` added to Docker environment

### Pipeline Hardening

- **Worker timeouts increased** — scribe 5→10m, auditor 12→20m, librarian 20→25m, dreamer 8→15m
- **Pipeline log rotation** — 30-day default, cleans `.log` and `.meta.json` files
- **Session pruning** — 14-day max age on session directories
- **WORKING.md regeneration** — runs after every scribe completion
- **`processJob()` default case** — unknown job types now throw instead of silently marking as done
- **Scribe payload validation** — required fields (`snapshotPath`, `sessionId`) checked before processing
- **`toWorkerPath()` null guard** — handles undefined input without crashing

### Type Safety Fixes

- **`truncate()` type guard** — handles non-string frontmatter gists that caused `text.replace is not a function`
- **`extractFirstParagraph()` type guard** — handles non-string content
- **Index entry gist** — uses `truncate()` instead of raw `.slice()` with cast, preventing crashes on non-string gists

### Dashboard

- Removed dead `ActivityPanel.tsx` (332 lines, never imported)
- CORS origin configurable via `MEMORY_DASHBOARD_CORS_ORIGIN` env var (default: `localhost:5173`)

### Notion Sync

- Webhook secret externalized to `${NOTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET}` env var in config
- Docker passthrough configured in `docker-start.sh`
- Webhook server starts when Notion sync is enabled (no longer requires secret to be set)
- Port 3100 exposed in Docker
- `skipInbound` configurable in config.yml (default: false)

### Dead Code Removed

- `src/graph-memory/pipeline/spawn.ts`
- `src/graph-memory/pipeline/observer.ts` (shell, logic in `observer-tools.ts`)
- `src/graph-memory/pipeline/compressor.ts` (shell, logic in `compressor-tools.ts`)

### Configuration

- `plugin.json` updated to v3.0.0 with all 7 commands and 9 agents registered
- `install.sh` symlinks all 12 commands
- `.gitignore` updated: `.DS_Store`, `graph-memory/`, `.env` patterns

### Edges Parsing Hardening

- **`Array.isArray` guard on `edges`/`anti_edges`** — auditor crashed when a node had non-array `edges` (single YAML object missing target). Replaced all `parsed.data.edges || []` with `Array.isArray` check across preflight, observer-tools, graph-ops, graph-index, mechanical-apply, and librarian. Same for `anti_edges`.
- **Daemon steward isolation** — try/catch around each steward so one failing steward doesn't block others.
- **execNtn env var injection** — injects `NOTION_API_TOKEN` into Docker container ntn calls, fixing keychain priority issue.

## 3.0.0 (2026-05-15) — Notion Sync Pipeline + Dashboard Enhancements

### Notion Sync Pipeline (new)

Two-way sync between graph-memory and a Notion workspace. Disk is agent-readable source of truth; Notion is a human-readable presentation layer ("Company Database of My Mind").

**Outbound sync:**
- Knowledge nodes grouped into wiki pages by category (patterns, architecture, preferences, archive, etc.)
- Decisions and briefs become database rows in dedicated databases
- Each project gets its own Notion page with project-specific content
- Chunked sync: 100 items per batch, sorted by confidence (highest first), daemon auto-enqueues next batch
- State file (`.notion-sync-state.json`) tracks page IDs, content hashes, and sync timestamps
- Diff-based: only changed items are synced

**Inbound sync:**
- Detects human edits in Notion pages and database rows
- Creates observations and deltas (never direct node mutations)
- Preserves the agent as the authority for graph structure

**Three-way merge:**
- When both graph and Notion have changed, human intent wins
- Agent information is preserved as callouts in the merged content
- Merge conflicts logged for review

**Consolidation:**
- Merges batched wiki-group pages into single category pages
- Archives the source batched pages after merge
- Reduces workspace page count (e.g. 63→31 pages in production)

**Infrastructure:**
- `notion-cli.ts` — CLI adapter wrapping `ntn` for all Notion API calls
- `notion-sync.ts` — State I/O, diff building, sync plan types, plan execution
- `notion-inbound.ts` — Inbound edit detection and merge I/O
- `notion-setup.ts` — Workspace setup with schema-aware property configuration
- `daemon.ts` — Job dispatch (`notion_sync`, `notion_inbound`, `notion_merge`), daily trigger
- `job-schema.ts` — `NotionSyncJobPayload` with `batchIndex` for chunked sync
- MCP actions: `notion_setup`, `notion_sync`, `notion_consolidate`
- Slash commands for Claude Code and OpenCode: `/notion-setup`, `/notion-sync`, `/notion-consolidate`
- Agent instructions: `agents/memory-notion-sync.md`, `agents/memory-notion-inbound.md`, `agents/memory-notion-merge.md`
- Uses Notion API v2026-03-11 with data sources for property management
- Design spec: `docs/notion-sync-spec.md`
- 48 tests in `tests/notion-sync.check.mjs`

### Dashboard Enhancements

- **Skills viewer** — new Skills section on the landing page with a card grid showing all generated skills (name, score, project, source node, refresh count). Click any card to expand and read the full slash command markdown content.
- **Notion Sync pipeline step** — step 7 in the pipeline flow diagram with purple accent. Pipeline cutoffs show sync status (enabled/disabled, last sync time, page/row counts, in-flight state, next scheduled sync hour).
- **Skills content endpoint** — `GET /api/skills/:name/content` reads the actual command file from the project directory.
- **Dashboard resilience** — `readAllJobs` now handles unknown job types with dynamic fallback instead of crashing.

### Pipeline Resilience Fixes

- Observer `processObserverOutputs` failed on stale observation files from prior runs — files are now unlinked after error
- `appendSessionLog` threw ENOENT for project names with `/` — parent directories are now ensured
- `normalizeBullet` in working update threw `text.replace is not a function` on non-string values — now guarded
- Decay archival stalled by over-broad category protection — archive targets are no longer skipped
- `reconcileProjectWorkingBacklog()` re-processed scribe jobs with invalid project paths (`private/tmp`) — now skips projects starting with `private/`, `tmp/`, or `/`

## 2.4.0 (2026-05-14) — Mental Model Architecture + Pipeline Improvements

### Mental Model System (folded into v2 pipeline)

Replaced `PRIORS.md` + `SOMA.md` with a structured JSON mental model. The v2 pipeline (`scribe → auditor → librarian → dreamer`) remains the active pipeline, but session-start injection now reads from the mental model instead of the old two-file approach.

**Global model** (`mind/model.json`):
- Cognitive style, decision patterns, preferences, guardrails, emotional profile, relational notes
- Companion `mind/whisper.txt` — pre-generated ~300-token injection paragraph
- `mind/observations.jsonl` — append-only observation feed

**Project models** (`lenses/{project}/`):
- Per-project tech stack, conventions, procedures, guardrails, active work, open threads
- Per-project `whisper.txt` and `observations.jsonl`
- Archivable and restorable via lens manager

**Session logs** (`sessions/{project}.jsonl`):
- Per-session records of shipped work, decisions, blocked items, open threads, next-session hints
- Auto-compaction: full detail < 3 days, summary 3–7 days, decisions-only 7–30 days, pruned > 30 days

### Merged Session Start

Session-start now uses a tiered injection strategy:

1. **If `GRAPH_MEMORY_V3=1` and whisper data exists** — injects from compressed whispers (~1,100 tokens total: global whisper ~400, project whisper ~500, session logs ~200, guardrails ~150)
2. **Otherwise (default)** — injects from `mind/model.json` + MAP + WORKING + PINNED + DREAMS, replacing the old PRIORS/SOMA with the structured mental model

Both paths share the same underlying data (`mind/model.json`). The v3 whisper path is a further compression that can be enabled when ready.

### v3 Pipeline Infrastructure (code present, not active by default)

The observer, compressor, and dreamer-v3 pipeline stages were built but rolled back after the v3 pipeline failed to validate in production (worker spawn storms, compressor never triggered, unprocessed observations). The v2 pipeline with improved prompts is the proven path.

- **Observer** — single LLM pass producing observations, session logs, and node upserts. Present in code, gated behind `GRAPH_MEMORY_V3=1`.
- **Compressor** — folds observations into mental models, generates whisper paragraphs. Present in code, not active.
- **Dreamer V3** — creative recombination against compressed models. Present in code, not active.

These stages can be re-enabled by setting `GRAPH_MEMORY_V3=1` when the v3 pipeline is validated.

### Pipeline Prompt Improvements

All four v2 pipeline agent prompts were rewritten:
- **Scribe**: Captures "true memory" (evolving opinions, frustrations, contradictions, half-formed ideas) not just hard facts. Added `mark_stale` delta type.
- **Auditor**: Added stale/contradictory node detection as highest priority. Added noise/bloat candidates section.
- **Librarian**: Prune-over-preserve philosophy. Handles stale nodes as second priority (after PRIORS compression). Rewrite-over-append approach.
- **Dreamer**: Unchanged (already good).

### Harness Adapter System

- `types.ts` — `HarnessAdapter` interface with `HarnessType`, `AdapterConfig`, `SessionStartResult`
- `claude-code.ts`, `opencode.ts`, `pi.ts`, `codex.ts` — harness-specific adapters
- `factory.ts` — adapter instantiation
- `shared.ts` — shared adapter logic

Each adapter declares capabilities (hooks, plugin events, MCP) and project doc filename.

### Project Document Bootstrapping

New `pipeline/bootstrap.ts` auto-generates project docs (CLAUDE.md / AGENT.md) from mental models:

- Reads global model, project model, observations, anti-patterns
- Generates structured sections (mental model, inject flow, project working)
- Preserves custom `<!-- custom start -->` / `<!-- custom end -->` sections
- Detects drift between current model state and existing doc content

### v3 Graph Index

New `pipeline/graph-index-v3.ts` replaces flat JSON array with Map-keyed structure:

- O(1) path lookups, category and project filtering
- Incremental add/remove without full rebuild
- Lazy load with mtime-based cache invalidation
- Anti-pattern queries for guardrail injection

### Key Files in WORKING Handoff

`project-working.ts` now extracts `keyFiles` from tool traces — files that were edited or created during a session. These appear in a new `## Files` section of per-project WORKING handoff, priming the next session with the most relevant file paths.

### YAML Frontmatter Repair

New `pipeline/yaml-repair.ts` handles real-world malformation patterns in node frontmatter:

- Unquoted colons in title/gist values
- Duplicated mapping keys
- Extra/missing trailing quotes on date values
- Bad indentation

### Dashboard Redesign

Complete dashboard overhaul (`memory-dashboard/`):

- **2-column layout** — main content + persistent activity rail with real-time SSE
- **Architecture view** — mental model inspector with global model, project models, whisper preview, inject flow diagram
- **Session replay** — per-session event timeline with tool traces and delta previews
- **Memory health** — 4-metric health grid (node count, avg confidence, coverage, staleness)
- **Dream actions** — accept/reject buttons for pending dream fragments
- **Node editing** — inline edit form for gist, content, confidence, tags
- **Pipeline status** — compact flow diagram showing v2 + v3 pipeline state
- New API endpoints: `/api/model`, `/api/startup-context`, `/api/project-working`, `/api/events` (SSE)
- New job types in dashboard: `observer`, `compressor`, `dreamer_v3`, `bootstrap_project_doc`

### Pipeline Improvements

- Pipeline concurrency raised from 1 to 4 (`daemonConcurrency: 4`)
- Stale worker reaping at 5 minutes (was implicit)
- Session cap at 5 with replace-over-append merge (was append-only)
- New job types: `observer`, `compressor`, `bootstrap_project_doc`, `dreamer_v3`

### Migration Script

New `scripts/migrate-v2-to-v3.ts` for migrating existing v2 graph data:

- Reads all active nodes, high-confidence ones feed into global and project models
- Generates whisper paragraphs from model content
- Builds v3 graph index from node files
- Supports dry-run (`npx tsx ...`) and apply (`--apply`) modes

### Other Changes

- **Impeccable skill** bundled (`.agents/skills/impeccable/`) with 30+ design reference docs and live browser tooling
- **Agent instructions** updated: scribe, auditor, librarian, dreamer v3, observer, compressor, working-updater
- **OpenCode extension** updated for v3 adapter support
- **Pi extension** updated for v3 adapter support
- `SPEC.md` and `AGENT.md` added for architecture documentation
- `skills-lock.json` for reproducible skill installations

## 2026-05-10 — Phase 5: Automation & Project Isolation

### Automatic decay on daemon tick
- `runDecay()` now runs on every daemon tick when no graph-level job (auditor/librarian/dreamer) is in progress
- If any nodes decay or archive, `regenerateCoreContextFiles()` fires automatically to keep MAP in sync
- First tick decayed 388 nodes and rebuilt MAP (166 entries from 771 nodes)

### Mechanical dream reinforcement
- `reinforceDreams()` in `tools.ts`: when a node is accessed via recall/search/read_node, any pending dream referencing that node gets +0.05 confidence and `reinforcement_sessions` incremented
- Called from `updateLastAccessed()` so all access paths trigger it
- New event type: `graph:dream_reinforced`

### Scribe default confidence raised to 0.6
- New nodes now start at 0.6 confidence (was 0.5)
- Updated in both `mechanical-apply.ts` and scribe prompt examples
- Reduces low-confidence noise creation

### Skillforge threshold lowered
- `scoreThreshold` lowered from 0.65 to 0.55
- More nodes should surface as skillforge candidates

### Project isolation cleanup
- Merged duplicate project names: `keel3/oliver` → `Keel3/keel3_oliver_demo`, `keel3/keel3_oliver_demo` (lowercase) → `Keel3/keel3_oliver_demo`, `ConnorCallahan01/cogni-code` → `agent_memory`
- Renamed working files for `ConnorCallahan01/cogni-code` → `agent_memory`
- Dashboard `deriveProjects()` now only shows projects with WORKING files — stale projects with only nodes no longer appear in the chip strip

### Roadmap rewrite
- Replaced the Phase 1–4 roadmap with a current-state document reflecting completed work, remaining issues (R1–R4), and Phase 5 implementation plan
- All 5 phases (1–5) now complete; deferred items documented separately

---

## 2026-05-08 — Phase 1–4: Token Budget, Quality, Dashboard

### Phase 1: Stop the bleeding
- Score-based PRIORS truncation in `graph-ops.ts` (generality, conciseness, specificity scoring)
- 15k total injection budget in `session-start.ts` (split: 4k global + 11k project)
- Pinned node budget enforcement (3k total, respects both pinned and session budgets)
- Orphan snapshot cleanup in daemon tick (>4hrs, no active job) — cleaned 193 on first run
- Token accounting in `/api/health` with per-layer counts, budgets, overBudget flag

### Phase 2: Quality over quantity
- `decay_rate: 0.05` on all new nodes (scribe template + all code paths)
- Auditor mechanically adds `decay_rate: 0.05` to nodes missing it; `decay.ts` falls back to 0.05
- Archive threshold 0.10 → 0.20 in config
- Dream promotion 0.5/3 sessions → 0.4/2 sessions
- Librarian PRIORS compression (Step 2): compresses verbose entries, demotes project-specific to nodes
- One-time data cleanup: PRIORS compressed 28,925 → 574 tokens, 43/58 stale pinned nodes unpinned

### Phase 3: Operational
- Project-aware MAP injection: `buildProjectMAP()` in session-start — top 8 project + 2 other per category
- Project detection never falls back to "global" — `deriveProjectName()` uses `parent/base` from cwd
- Access tracking on `search`, `listEdges`, and connected nodes from `recall`
- Health score: 8 factors (node coverage 15, staleness 15, orphans 10, MAP 10, PRIORS 15, pinned 15, low-confidence 10, budget 10 = 100)
- Pipeline stats (scribe/auditor/librarian/dreamer/skillforge job counts) in health endpoint

### Phase 4: Intelligence
- Cross-session dedup in `mechanical-apply.ts` — `findSimilarNode()` checks gist word overlap >50% within category
- Project-first dashboard with auto-select, per-project scoping, injection budget in top bar

### Dashboard
- Complete CSS rewrite with OKLCH light theme design system
- App.tsx: project-first nav (top bar switcher), 4 views, persistent activity rail
- BriefView, GraphExplorer, ContextView, SessionReplay implemented
- ActivityPanel: persistent 300px right rail with Pipeline, Skills, Jobs, Health, Dreams, Audit, Events
- Memory health: GET `/api/health` with 8-factor score, token accounting, pipeline stats
- Dreams: POST accept/reject endpoints + action buttons
- Node editing via PUT `/api/node/:path` + inline form
